## Comments
```bash
;YOU CAN ADD A COMMENT TO YOUR CODE WITH A SEMICOLON LIKE THIS
```

## Outputs
```bash
$OUT [14] = FALSE ;SETS THE VALUE OF OUTPUT 14 TO FALSE
```

## Wait
```bash
WAIT SEC 5 ;THE PROGRAM WAITS 5 SECONDS BEFORE CONTINUING 
```

## For Loop
```bash
FOR i = 1 TO 6 ;SET i TO THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU WANT THE FOR LOOP TO ITERATE
  $IN [1] = TRUE
  WAIT SEC 3
  $IN [1] = FALSE
ENDFOR
```

## For Loop With Step

```bash
DECL INT X ;DECLARE THE VARIABLE X AS AN INTEGER
X = 0 ;SET THE INITIAL VALUE OF X TO 0

FOR i = 1 TO 6 STEP 2 ;STEP 2 INCREMENTS THE FOR LOOP BY 2 EACH TIME (i = 1, 3, 5)
    ; INCREMENT X BY i ON EACH LOOP ITERATION
    X = i + X ;ADD THE CURRENT VALUE OF i TO X (X = i + X)
ENDFOR

; OUTPUT:
; First iteration (i = 1): X = 1
; Second iteration (i = 3): X = 4
; Third iteration (i = 5): X = 9
```
```bash
DECL INT X ;DECLARE THE VARIABLE X AS AN INTEGER
X = 0 ;SET THE INITIAL VALUE OF X TO 0

FOR i = 6 TO 1 STEP -2 ;STEP -2 DECREMENTS THE FOR LOOP BY 2 EACH TIME (i = 6, 4, 2)
    ; INCREMENT X BY i ON EACH LOOP ITERATION
    X = i + X ;ADD THE CURRENT VALUE OF i TO X (X = i + X)
ENDFOR

; OUTPUT:
; First iteration (i = 6): X = 6
; Second iteration (i = 4): X = 10
; Third iteration (i = 2): X = 12
```
## While Loop
```bash
WHILE $IN [12] = TRUE ;WHILE INPUT 12 IS TRUE INPUT 29 IS ALSO SET TO TRUE
  $OUT [29] = TRUE
ENDWHILE
```
