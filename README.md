Welcome to the **KUKA** GitHub repository! This project is a collection of helpful KUKA Robot Language (KRL) resources, including syntax guides, code examples, templates, and best practices for programming KUKA industrial robots.

## What You'll Find Here

- Ready-to-test `.SRC` and `.DAT` program templates  
- Examples of robot motion commands (`PTP`, `LIN`, `CIRC`)  
- Speed control and configuration commands  
- Program flow logic: loops, conditionals, interrupts  
- Variable declarations and initialization with examples  
- Commented and documented code for easy understanding  

## Project Status
This repository is under active development and expansion. It is continuously updated with new examples, templates, and reference guides to support learning and working with KUKA KRL. Check back regularly for helpful additions and improvements.
